## Face Detection System for digital camera :camera: :detective:

### Description
ProCam s.p.a is planning to launch a new compact and inexpensive digital camera for budding photographers.<br>
You will be hired as a Data Scientist to create the system for identifying faces in images, this will then allow 
the photo technicians to optimise the settings for a selfie with one or more people.<br>
This is a computer vision problem, more specifically Face Detection.<br>
You have to provide a scikit-learn pipeline that takes an input image and returns a list with the coordinates of 
bounding boxes where faces are present, if there are no faces in the image the list will obviously be empty.<br>
